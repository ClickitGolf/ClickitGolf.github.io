  <h1>My Accomplishments<h1/>

  <h2>In the Beginning</h2>

  <p>After getting married and having children, I was having a hard time deciding what I wanted to do with my life. I always had jobs where I would move quickly up the latter to management, but would find myself feeling less challenged in a short peIiod of time. I finally decided it was time to get an education.</p>

  <h3>Studied Business at San Diego Miramar Community College</h3>

  <p>During high school, I was never into the learning process. Attending class was a chore and I would much rather be hanging out with my friends. College was a different story. I loved learning! I graduated with high honors and on the Dean's List.</p>

  <h4>San Diego State University</h4>

  <p>As someone who never thought they would go to college, I was proud to be accepted to a university that I had always dreamt of attending. I soon realized that this was much harder than community college, but was up for the challenge.</p>

  <h4>Marketing & Support Manager at ClickitGolf</h4>

  <p>I lucked out and scored an interview with an awesome company where I could put my skills to good use. I quickly found that being an assistant to the CEO and doing accounts payable were not all that interesting or challenging to me. My bosses were fed up with there website developers and asked if I could try my hand at managing their database. I ended up being a natural! This was my calling and I love having the creative freedom to help create a website that has helped their business grow exponentially.</p>
